## 🧠 Algorithm Challenges

Here are some algorithm problems with solutions in Swift:

- 🔁 **[Has Duplicate](./hasDuplicate.swift)**  
  *Given an array of integers, determine if any value appears at least twice.*

- ➕ **[Two Sum](./TwoSum.swift)**  
  *Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.*

- 🔢 **[How Many Numbers Are Smaller?](./HowManyNumsAreSmaller.swift)**  
  *For each number in the array, count how many numbers are smaller than it.*

- ❓ **[Find Missing Number](./findMissingNumber.swift)**  
  *Find the missing number from an array containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`.*

- **[Minimum Time Visiting All Points](./MinimumTimeVisitingAllPoints.swift)**
    *Find the min time for visiting all points on a 2D plane.*

- ##[How many nums are smaller?](./HowManyNumsAreSmaller.swift)
    *Find how many nums are smaller than n[i]*
